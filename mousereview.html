         <h2>Review</h2>
         <div class="review">
            <p>The G502 is a mouse from logitech that promises alot but does it fulfill those promises?</p>
            <p>All those crazy features that Logitech champions are all secondary to the reliability and general comfort of the mouse.</p>
            <p>With respects to the reliability of the mouse, I have not had any issues in the years following the purchase of the mouse. It has endured many years of constant use and it shows no sign of breaking anytime soon.</p>
            <p>It is also quite confortable to hold because of the larger thumb rest and textured grips.</p>
            <p>The slick pads on the bottom of the mouse ensure very little friction and allows the mouse to glide smoothly across the mousepad.</p>
            <p>There are enough programmable buttons to work with without it getting in the way of comfort.</p>
            <p>Although quite a step up in price from "regluar" mice the price is worth it considering the comfort, reliability, and extra features that you would gain.</p>
            <p>All in all I would wholeheartedly recommend getting this specific mouse or the newer version since the changes to the newer version are minimal.</p>
